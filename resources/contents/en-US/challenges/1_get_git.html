    <h2>Git</h2>
    <p>Git is free <strong>open source software</strong> (the <a href="https://github.com/git/git">source code is
        public</a>) written by Linus Torvalds who also wrote the Linux operating system's kernel. </p>
    <p>Git is a program for keeping track of changes over time, known in programming as <strong>version control</strong>.
        If you've used a track changes feature in a text editing software then you're already familiar with the concept!

    <h3>Install Git</h3>
    <p>If you're attending the MNXB01 course at Lund University, git is already installed on Iridium.</p>
    <p>If you are using your own computer, refer to the course slides for more info on how to install git.</p>
    <p>The creators of this tutorial recommend installing Git on your computer by downloading the 
        <a href="https://desktop.github.com">GitHub Desktop</a> app. We will NOT use the desktop app in Git-it 
        (we're learning terminal!) but it includes Git and is
        the easiest way to install Git on all platforms in the same way. I am not sure it will work on a cluster...</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows</strong>: Use the <strong>Git Shell</strong> for your terminal.</li>
        <li><strong>Mac</strong>: Open GitHub Desktop and from Preferences, select the command line tools install. Use
            the <strong>terminal</strong> app as your terminal.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>Already have Git or not sure? Type <code>git --version</code> in your terminal and if it returns a version number
        higher than <code>1.7.10</code>, you're set! For more information, visit the <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git
            website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Git Software</h2>
    <p>The GitHub Desktop app can do a lot of things with Git but not all, which is why learning the terminal is
        important. But once you've got that down, you'll be glad to have the desktop app because it organizes your
        project's information more visually, like the GitHub website.</p>

    <p>Git on its own isn't like other programs on your computer. You'll likely not see an icon on your desktop, but it
        will always be available to you and you'll be able to access it at anytime from your terminal or Git desktop
        applications.</p>

    <h3>Configure Git</h3>
    <p>Once Git is installed (as it is on Iridium), open your <strong>terminal</strong>.
        You can verify that Git is really there by typing:</p>

    <p><code class="shell">git --version </code></p>

    <p>This will return the version of Git on your computer and look something like this:</p>

    <p><code class="comment">git version 1.9.1</code></p>

    <p>Next, configure Git so it knows to associate your work to you:</p>
    <p>Set your name:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.name "Your Name"</code></p>
    <p>Now set your email:</p>
    <p><code class="shell">git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"</code></p>
    <p>Note that the <code>--global</code> option will set up the information in your user's <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file.</p>
    <p>The default behavior if you do not specify <code>--global</code> is <code>--local</code> which means these settings
       will be copied locally in the repository's database, <code>.git/config</code></p>
    <p>You can check your current configuration with<code>git config -l</code></p>

    <h3>Dollar Signs in Code Documentation</h3>
    <p>Dollar signs <code>$</code> are often used in programming documentation to represent the prompt, meaning that the line is <strong>command
        line</strong> code (see the code snippets above). You don't actually type the <code>$</code> in though, only
        type what comes after.</p>
